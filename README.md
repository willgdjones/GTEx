This directory contains the files and folders for my PhD project. I am looking to extract features from images using neural networks and then associate these the genetic information.

This repository is designed to be executable by anyone at the EBI, or who uses LSF at their research institute.

To download the data, use:
`make download`

to generate covering patches of the tissues, use:

`make covering_patches`
